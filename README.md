# 🎭 Role Changer Bot

A simple Discord bot that lets users change their own role from a select menu.  
Only specific roles (defined by you) can be selected, and only certain users or admins can access the command.

## 🚀 Features
- `/role change` — lets a user pick a new role from a dropdown list.  
- Automatically removes any previously assigned role before adding the new one.  
- Restricts access to certain users or roles (optional).  
- Safe permission checks — the bot only changes roles it has access to.
