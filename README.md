# 🎭 Role Changer Bot

A simple Discord bot that lets users change their own role from a select menu.  
Only specific roles (defined by you) can be selected, and only certain users or admins can access the command.

---

## 🚀 Features
- `/role change` — lets a user pick a new role from a dropdown list.  
- Automatically removes any previously assigned role before adding the new one.  
- Restricts access to certain users or roles (optional).  
- Safe permission checks — the bot only changes roles it has access to.  

---
 💬 Command Usage

Once the bot is running:

Type /role change in your server.

Select your desired role from the dropdown.

The bot will remove your previous role and add the new one.

🧠 Notes

The bot’s role must be higher than the roles it assigns.
(Move it to the top of your server’s role list.)

Requires the Manage Roles permission.

Roles that no longer exist are skipped automatically.
